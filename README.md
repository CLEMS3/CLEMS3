# Hello ! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm CLEMS3, a computer science student passionate about everything computer related. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects.

## About Me

I'm a 19 year old student at INSA de Lyon, studying computer science. I love sports, reading, philosophy, and of course technology. I am always excited to learn new things in the realms of IA, cybersecurity and development.

## Projects

Here are some highlighted projects I've been working on:

### Quizz

One of my first pygame project dating from high school. It's a quiz based on a csv file, with several game modes, menus and even a soundex algorithm to prevent spelling mistakes, all available in both French and English.

### Color Scale Generator

A basic website, in HTML, CSS and JS, which allows you to generate a scale of shades between two colors, with the possibility to pick the color at a precise percentage. It can be useful for mapmaking or to display data.

### RISK

A pygame reproduction of the famous game. You can play from 3 to 6 players. The game manages the missions of each player, the attack system, the troup distribution etc... It's challenging because of the complex rules and because of the complex display of the game. In addition to that, we have a launcher, in Tkinter, with a user gestion, requiring to register or to connect before launching a game. This project was made in collaboration with [olmetaprogrammer](https://github.com/olmetaprogrammer), [AntoinePscl](https://github.com/AntoinePscl) and [vitto4](https://github.com/vitto4)
